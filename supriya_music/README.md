# Supriya Music

🎵 **Basic Examples for the Supriya System**

## Overview

`supriya_music` provides fundamental examples and utilities for working with the [Supriya](https://github.com/josiah-wolf-oberholtzer/supriya) system - a Python interface for SuperCollider.

## Purpose

This toolkit is designed to:

- **Demonstrate basic Supriya concepts** through practical examples
- **Provide starting points** for SuperCollider synthesis in Python
- **Showcase common patterns** for audio programming with Supriya
- **Serve as learning material** for those new to the Supriya ecosystem

## What is Supriya?

Supriya is a Python library that provides a programmatic interface to the SuperCollider audio synthesis server. It allows you to:

- Create and control synthesizers
- Build complex audio processing graphs
- Generate and manipulate audio in real-time
- Integrate SuperCollider's powerful synthesis capabilities into Python workflows

## Getting Started

Run the toolkit to see available examples:

```bash
python -m supriya_music
```

Explore specific examples:

```bash
python -m supriya_music hello
```

## Examples Included

- **Basic synthesis patterns**
- **Audio effects processing**
- **Real-time parameter control**
- **SynthDef creation and management**
